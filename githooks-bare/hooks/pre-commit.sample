# This script checks if the branch name contains a Jira ID in the format SRE-123.
# If the branch name does not match, it rejects the commit with an error message.
# If the branch name is valid, it allows the commit to proceed.
# Usage: Place this script in the .git/hooks directory of your bare repository.
# Make sure to give it execute permissions: chmod +x pre-commit
# Note: This script is intended for use in a bare repository's hooks directory.
# It reads the old and new revisions and the reference name from standard input.
# It checks the branch name against a regex pattern for Jira IDs.
